# PLOTCO - SIA GIT Hackathon

## 🌎 What is PLOTCO? 🌎

The shift to remote work has changed the way people interact with one another in organisations. While there is an increase in meetings through online platforms, informal interactions and casual chitchats have decreased over the past 2 years.

PLOTCO is here to help. We have a variety of rooms, each with a different purpose and environment that will allow you to sit down with your coworkers and enjoy a friendly Friday evening catching up with one another. You can also organise team events such as movie nights to bond with team members and get a chance to better know one another. We are not just limited to casual events, feel free to book a meeting room for your next weekly team meeting.

PLOTCO is a project built by 3 Singapore Airlines (SIA) staff from the KrisLab team as part of a Hackathon project.
